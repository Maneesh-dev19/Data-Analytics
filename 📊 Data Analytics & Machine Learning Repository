This repository contains various Machine Learning and Data Analytics projects implemented using Python. The projects cover supervised learning, regression models, classification models, and deep learning techniques.

📁 Project Overview
1️⃣ Univariate Linear Regression (UnivariateLR.ipynb)
📌 Dataset: A dataset containing a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (y).
📌 Objective: Predict the dependent variable using Univariate Linear Regression.

Key Features:
Simple linear regression model built using Scikit-Learn.
Visualization of regression line using Matplotlib.
Evaluation of model performance.


2️⃣ Mini Project: Heart Disease Prediction (MiniProject.ipynb)
📌 Dataset: heart.csv (Heart Disease Dataset)
📌 Objective: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical features.

Dataset Description:
Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Male (M) or Female (F).
ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (ATA, NAP, ASY, etc.).
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol levels.
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
HeartDisease: Target variable (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease).
Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
Feature correlation heatmap to identify important attributes.
Random Forest Classifier for heart disease prediction.
Performance evaluation using accuracy scores.


3️⃣ Final Project (fp.ipynb)
